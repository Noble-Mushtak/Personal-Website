<p>Hello! I'm Noble Mushtak and welcome to my Web site!</p>

<p>I am currently a second-year undergraduate at Northeastern majoring in computer science and maths. I like learning new programming languages (recently I've been <a href="https://ilyasergey.net/pnp/pnp.pdf">learning Coq</a>) and I'm interested in programming language research. I also enjoy <a href="http://mathserver.neu.edu/robin/Putnam/">Putnam problems</a> and <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/Noble_Mushtak">competitive programming</a>.</p>

<p>If you'd like to learn more about my past work, you can check out <a href="https://github.com/Noble-Mushtak">my GitHub</a> or read <a href="{% static "resume.pdf" %}">my resume here</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to reach out to me, please contact me at <a href="mailto:noblemushtak.public@gmail.com">noblemushtak.public@gmail.com</a>.</p>
