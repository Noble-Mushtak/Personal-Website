<p>The following was a puzzle presented to Marshwood GT students on February 15, 2019. Have fun doing math!</p><p>In AP Physics, you've probably learned about conservation of angular momentum, which says that angular momentum within a system of objects does not change if no external force acts upon the system. Today, we will use conservation of angular momentum to prove the Law of Sines.</p><strong>Part 1</strong>:<div class="center"><img src="{% static "blog/img/math-puzzle-feb-15-fig1.png" %}" alt="Diagram of forces acting on two point-masses"/></div><p>In the above diagram, there is a system of two point-masses of mass \(m_1\) and \(m_2\). Furthermore, angular momentum and torque are being measured relative to the origin \(O\), and masses \(m_1, m_2\) are \(r_1, r_2\) away from the origin. There is a force \(\vec{F}\) acting on \(m_1\) and a force \(-\vec{F}\) acting on \(m_2\). In other words, the force acting on \(m_2\) is equal and opposite to that acting on \(m_1\).</p><p>Given that there are no external forces acting on the system, explain why the force acting on \(m_2\) must be equal and opposite to that acting on \(m_1\). Moreover, explain why both force vectors must be parallel to the line between \(m_1\) and \(m_2\).</p><hr/><p><strong>Part 2</strong>:</p><div class="center"><img src="{% static "blog/img/math-puzzle-feb-15-fig2.png" %}" alt="Diagram of perpendicular components of forces acting on two-point masses"/></div><p>In the new diagram, \(F_{1,\perp}\) represents the component of \(\vec{F}\) perpendicular to \(r_1\) and \(F_{2,\perp}\) represents the component of \(-\vec{F}\) perpendicular to \(r_2\). Using your knowledge of torque and conservation of angular momentum, show that:</p>$$r_1F_{1,\perp}-r_2F_{2,\perp}=0\implies r_1F_{1,\perp}=r_2F_{2,\perp}$$<hr/><p><strong>Part 3</strong>:</p><div class="center"><img src="{% static "blog/img/math-puzzle-feb-15-fig3.png" %}" alt="Diagram of angles between force vectors acting on two point-masses"/></div><p>Finally, we've labeled four of the angles in the diagram: \(A,B,C,D\). Using your knowledge of geometry and trigonometry, show that:</p>$$F_{1,\perp}=\lvert \vec{F}\rvert\sin A$$ $$F_{2,\perp}=\lvert \vec{F}\rvert\sin B$$<p>You do not need Law of Sines to prove either of these equations. Note that \(\lvert \vec{F}\rvert\) represents the length of the force vector \(\vec{F}\).</p><hr/><p><strong>Part 4</strong>: Combining Parts 2 and 3, we now have:</p>$$r_1\lvert \vec{F}\rvert\sin A=r_2\lvert \vec{F}\rvert\sin B$$<p>Use this equation to prove the Law of Sines:</p>$$\frac{\sin A}{r_2}=\frac{\sin B}{r_1}$$
