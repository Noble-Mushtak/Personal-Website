<p>The following was a puzzle presented to Marshwood GT students on February 1, 2019. Have fun doing math!</p><p>Evaluate the following integral:</p>$$\int_0^x\sqrt{1-t^2}dt$$<p><strong>Part 1:</strong> The image below is a drawing of a semicircle centered at the origin with radius 1.</p><div class="center"><img alt="Picture of upper-half of unit circle" src="{% static "blog/img/math-puzzle-feb-1-graph1.png" %}"/></div><p>Shade in the area represented by the integral above.</p><p><hr/><strong>Part 2:</strong> Let's break the area up into a triangle and an arc.</p><div class="center"><img alt="Picture of shaded arc and right triangle" src="{% static "blog/img/math-puzzle-feb-1-graph2.png" %}"/></div><p>What is the area of this triangle? HINT: Use Pythagorean theorem to find the height and then use \(A=\frac{1}{2}bh\) to find the area.</p><details><summary>Click here to show/hide the solution to Part 2.<span class="space-filler"></span></summary>The radius of the circle, and thus the hypotenuse of the triangle, is \(1\). Furthermore, the base of the triangle is \(x\). Therefore, if we let \(h\) be the height, by Pythagorean theorem:$$x^2+h^2=1\implies h=\sqrt{1-x^2}$$Thus, the area is:$$A=\frac{1}{2}bh=\frac{1}{2}x\sqrt{1-x^2}$$</details><hr/><p><strong>Part 3:</strong> Hereâ€™s a picture of the circle again, except now, the central angle of the circle is labeled \(\theta\):</p><div class="center"><img alt="Picture of shaded arc with central angle theta and right triangle" src="{% static "blog/img/math-puzzle-feb-1-graph3.png" %}"/></div><p>What is the area of this arc? HINT: First, you need to find \(\theta\). Use alternating interior angles to show that one of the acute angles in the right triangle is \(\theta\). Then, use trig functions to solve for \(\theta\) in terms of \(x\). Finally, use the formula \(A=\frac{1}{2}r^2\theta\) to find the area of the arc.</p><details><summary>Click here to show/hide the solution to Part 3.<span class="space-filler"></span></summary>By alternating interior angles, the angle opposite the base is equal to \(\theta\). Now, \(\sin\) is "opposite over hypotenuse," so we get the following:$$\sin(\theta)=\frac{x}{1}=x\implies \theta=\arcsin x$$Now, the area of the arc is:$$A=\frac{1}{2}r^2\theta=\frac{1}{2}\cdot 1^2\cdot \arcsin x=\frac{1}{2}\arcsin x$$</details><hr/><p><strong>Part 4:</strong> Add your answers from Parts 2 and 3 to evaluate the original integral.</p><details><summary>Click here to show/hide the solution to Part 4.<span class="space-filler"></span></summary>$$\int_0^x \sqrt{1-t^2}dt=\frac{1}{2}x\sqrt{1-x^2}+\frac{1}{2}\arcsin x$$</details>
