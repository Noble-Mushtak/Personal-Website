<p>In most United States elections, people vote for their favorite candidate and the candidate with the most votes win. This system is often referred to the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Plurality_voting_system">plurality voting system</a>, because candidates can often win as long as they get a plurality of the votes, even if they don't have a majority. A good recent example of this is the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Maine_gubernatorial_election,_2014">2014 Maine gubenatorial election</a>, where Republican Paul LePage won with only 48.2% of the vote because the other two candidates split the rest of the votes: Democratic Mike Michaud received 43.4% of the vote and Independent Eliot Cutler received 8.4% of the vote. However, although Cutler is an independent, he <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Eliot_Cutler.htm">leans liberal on many issues</a>, so it's very likely that if Cutler was not in the race, most of his votes would have gone to the Democrat and Mike Michaud would have won the election instead of Paul LePage. This means that Paul LePage won the governor election even though a majority of people may have preferred Mike Michaud or Eliot Cutler over him. This phenomenon where two similar candidates, like Mike Michaud and Eliot Cutler, end up hurting each other by splitting the vote and a third, less appealing candidate wins the election is commonly known as <a href="https://www.electology.org/spoiler-effect">the spoiler effect</a>. Because the spoiler effect had such an impact on Maine's gubenatorial elections, Maine <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/04/ranked-choice-voting-maine/557669/">recently adopted an alternative system known as ranked-choice voting</a>, where voters can rank the preferences of their candidates and the winner is determined based off their rankings. (To be clear, in 2018, ranked-choice voting will only be used for the primaries because <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-does-ranked-choice-voting-mean-for-voters-in-maine/">the Supreme Court ruled ranked-choice voting as unconstitutional</a> for the gubenatorial and state legislature general elections. However, voters <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Maine_Question_1,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Delayed_Enactment_and_Automatic_Repeal_Referendum_(June_2018)">approved Question 1</a>, meaning ranked-choice voting will be used for the US senator and US representative general elections.) More specifically, Maine has the system of <a href="https://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">instant-runoff voting</a>, which is a specific algorithm designed to pick the winner based off the voters' rankings. Even though in Maine, "ranked-choice" and "instant-runoff" have become virtually synonymous, instant-runoff voting is simply one type of ranked-choice voting and there are other algorithms that are also made for ranked-choice voting. Furthermore, other cities like Burlington, Vermont have tried instant-runoff voting and Burlington later <a href="http://www.sightline.org/2017/08/24/why-this-little-east-coast-city-plays-a-big-role-in-democracy-reform/">repealed instant-runoff after a contentious mayoral election in 2009</a>. Now, I think it's worth examining what exactly happened in the Burlington 2009 election and how other algorithms compare to instant-runoff. Specifically, I will be comparing the Condorcet criterion to instant-runoff because I think the Condorcet criterion would have led to a better outcome in this election than instant-runoff.</p>

<p>First, I want to clearly define some of the terms I will be using. Sometimes, I will refer to a candidate's "ranking", which refers to if they got first, second, or third place in the overall election. For example, in the 2014 Maine gubenatorial election, Paul LePage was first, Mike Michaud was second, and Eliot Cutler was third. Even though any place after first might not seem like it matters because only first place wins, this kind of vocabulary helps us talk about the relative rankings of certain candidates more generally. Also, I want to more clearly define what the spoiler effect is. For the mathematically inclined, the spoiler effect is any violation of <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives">the independence of irrelevant alternatives axiom</a>. In simpler terms, the spoiler effect is when the relative ranking of two candidates changes if a third candidate is introduced or eliminated. For example, in the original 2014 Maine election, LePage is ranked higher than Michaud. However, if the third-party Eliot Cutler was removed from the election, then most of his votes would have gone to Michaud and Michaud would have likely been ranked higher than LePage in the final results. Thus, the 2014 Maine election is an example of the spoiler effect. Finally, if you have never heard of instant-runoff voting, please <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5SLQXNpzsk">watch this video about instant-runoff</a> in order to understand the instant-runoff algorithm. The Condorcet criterion will be explained later in this blog post, but it will be assumed that you are familiar with instant-runoff voting from here on.</p>

<p>Now, with this knowledge in mind, the Burlington 2009 election can be analyzed. This election has three candidates: Democratic Andy Montroll, Progressive Bob Kiss, and Republican Kurt Wright. Unfortunately, I could not find a simple description of all of the ballots in this election. However, based off data from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110725111725/http://www.burlingtonvotes.org/20090303/2009%20Burlington%20Mayor%20Round.htm">burlingtonvotes.org</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121014131712/http://www.uvm.edu/~vlrs/IRVassessment.pdf">the University of Vermont</a>, I was able to roughly estimate the general distribution of the ballots in this election. The distribution I estimated is rather complicated and has a lot of different ballot types, as shown below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&asymp;455 ranked Montroll as first, while ranking both Wright and Kiss as second (i.e. they did not rank either Wright or Kiss, so they are treated as equal rank)</li>
  <li>&asymp;767 ranked Montroll as first, Wright as second, and Kiss as third</li><li>&asymp;1332 ranked Montroll as first, Kiss as second, and Wright as third</li>
  <li>&asymp;1285 ranked Wright as first, while ranking both Montroll and Kiss as second</li>
  <li>&asymp;1517 ranked Wright as first, Montroll as second, and Kiss as third</li>
  <li>&asymp;495 ranked Wright as first, Kiss as second, and Montroll as third</li>
  <li>&asymp;544 ranked Kiss as first, without ranking anyone else</li><li>&asymp;2067 ranked Kiss as first, Montroll as second, and Wright as third</li>
  <li>&asymp;371 ranked Kiss as first, Wright as second, and Montroll as third</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of this complexity, I think it is fair if I simplify the election in a way that protects the major ballot types and preserves the general properties of this election. This simplification is described below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>500 ranked Montroll as first, while ranking both Wright and Kiss as second</li>
  <li>1350 ranked Montroll as first, Kiss as second, and Wright as third</li>
  <li>1300 ranked Wright as first, while ranking both Montrol and Kiss as second</li>
  <li>1500 ranked Wright as first, Montroll as second, and Kiss as third</li>
  <li>2100 ranked Kiss as first, Montroll as second, and Wright as third</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, immediately, it is worth noticing that 500+1350=1850 people ranked Montroll as first, 1300+1500=2800 people ranked Wright as first, and 2100 people ranked Kiss as first. This means that under plurality voting, Wright would have won the election, Kiss would have come in second, and Montroll would be third. However, in instant-runoff voting, it simply means that Montroll is eliminated since he has the least number of first-place ballots. Thus, the 500 ballots where Wright and Kiss are both second are thrown out and the 1350 ballots where Kiss is second go to Kiss. Thus, Kiss now has 2100+1350=3450 ballots and Wright still has 2800 ballots, so Kiss beats Wright. This means that under instant-runoff, Kiss comes in first, Wright comes in second, and Montroll comes in third.</p>

<p>Now, at first glance, it looks like instant-runoff succeeded in avoiding a spoiler effect in this election. Under plurality voting, the liberal vote was divided between Democrat and Progressive, so the Republican wins. In contrast, under instant-runoff voting, the votes for Montroll go to their second choice of Kiss, so Bob Kiss fairly wins the election. However, the problem with instant-runoff in this case is that <em class="underline">it assumes Andy Montroll should be eliminated just because he has the least number of first-place votes</em>. In reality, Montroll is only 2100-1850=250 votes behind Bob Kiss, so it's not that unlikely that a few hundred people could have changed their minds from Kiss to Montrol and Kiss would have been eliminated instead. In that theoretical scenario, if Kiss was eliminated from the election, Montroll would have received all of Kiss' 2100 votes, meaning Montroll would have 1850+2100=3950 votes over Wright's 2800 ballots, so Montroll beats Wright and wins the election. Thus, after Kiss' elimination, Montroll is ranked higher than Wright, even though Wright is ranked higher than Montroll in the original election. Therefore, this is another example of the spoiler effect: In the instant-runoff election, Kiss is a spoiler for Montroll vs. Wright.</p>

<p>To some people, this spoiler may not seem very important since neither Montroll nor Wright actually won the original instant-runoff election. Obviously, if Kiss was eliminated, then Montroll would get all the liberal votes and win the election. Therefore, let's now analyze the scenario where Wright is eliminated from the election. It might seem weird to see Wright being eliminated since he has a plurality of the first-place votes, but in reality, if &asymp;400 votes changed from Wright to Montroll and &asymp;400 votes changed from Wright to Kiss, it's not hard to see a scenario where Wright has the least number first-place votes. Thus, if Wright is eliminated from the election, then the 1300 ballots where both Montroll and Kiss are second are thrown out and 1500 votes where Montroll is second go to Montroll. Now, Montroll has 1850+1500=3350 votes as compared to Kiss' 2100 votes, meaning Montroll beats Kiss. To be clear, if Wright is eliminated from the election, then Montroll is ranked higher than Kiss even though Kiss beat Montroll in the original election. Thus, in the instant-runoff election, Wright is a spoiler for Montroll vs. Kiss. This is a very consequential spoiler because it implies that Montroll is actually a better winner for the mayoral election than Kiss. For the 1500 people who ranked Wright as first, Montroll as second, and Kiss as third, it means that they would have been better off ranking Montroll as first and Wright as second instead because that way, Montroll would have won the election instead of Kiss, which would be in more line with their preferences. Thus, under instant-runoff voting, there is still a spoiler effect and strategic voting because Republicans have to vote for Democrats as their first choice in order to avoid getting the Progressive candidate. <strong>This means instant-runoff voting has not actually solved the essential problem that existed in plurality voting.</strong></p>

<p>Before moving on, I think it's worth contemplating why Montroll would beat Kiss and Wright if he faced either of them one-on-one, yet had the least number of first-place votes. If one looks closer, it can be seen that Montroll is never actually ranked third in any of the ballots. (This does occur in the real election, but only for &asymp;866 out of &asymp;8833 ballots.) Meanwhile, many people who voted for Wright ranked Kiss third and many people who voted for Kiss ranked Wright third. This data tells me that the electorate was quite divided toward the Republican candidate and the Progressive candidate, so people gravitated toward one of these extremes as their first-choice, leaving the centrist Democrat with the least number of first-choice votes. However, despite this, several Republican and Progressive voters ranked Montroll as second, meaning the centrist had a broad appeal across the political spectrum and was a good compromise winner. Thus, by immediately eliminating the candidate with the least number of votes, instant-runoff prevented a compromise candidate from winning and instead elected a less-liked candidate from the Progressive party. Regardless of if one is a progressive, liberal, or conservative, I think everyone can see the value of electing candidates like Montroll who is most preferred across the whole electorate and that instant-runoff's failure to elect candidates with the most appeal is a serious flaw in its design.</p>

<p>At this point, the pertinent question becomes how to rigorously measure the candidate that is "most preferred." This is where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij-LRGZkEHg">the Condorcet criterion</a> becomes relevant. In a ranked-choice voting system, if there is any candidate who would beat every other candidate in a one-on-one race, then that candidate is called the "Condorcet winner." The Condorcet criterion simply says that if there exists a Condorcet winner in an election, then that person should win the election. Now, to figure out the Condorcet winner, first, all of the possible one-on-one elections between the candidates must be listed. Since there are only three candidates, this isn't too hard: The possible one-on-one races are Kiss vs. Wright, Montroll vs. Wright, and Montroll vs. Kiss. Then, the winner of each of these races must be determined based off the relative rankings of these candidates in each of the ballots.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kiss vs. Wright</strong>: 500 ballots ranked Kiss and Wright as equal, so these are ignored. 1350+2100=3450 ballots ranked Kiss over Wright while 1300+1500=2800 ranked Wright over Kiss. Thus, Kiss would beat Wright in a one-on-one election.</li>
  <li><strong>Montrol vs. Wright</strong>: 500+1350+2100=3950 ballots ranked Montroll over Wright, while 1300+1500=2800 ballots ranked Wright over Montroll. Thus, Montroll would beat Wright in a one-on-one election.</li>
  <li><strong>Montroll vs. Kiss</strong>: 1300 ballots ranked Montroll and Kiss as equal, so these are ignored. 500+1350+1500=3350 ballots ranked Montroll above Kiss while 2100 ballots ranked Kiss above Montroll, so Montroll would beat Kiss in a one-on-one election.</li>
</ul>

<p>After listing all of the one-on-one elections, the candidate who won every one of their one-on-one elections must be found. Since Wright lost in Kiss vs. Wright, Wright can not be the Condorcet winner. Also, since Kiss lost in Montroll vs. Kiss, Kiss can not be the Condorcet winner. Thus, since Montroll won all of his one-on-one elections, he wins the election under the Condorcet criterion. The advantage of the Condorcet criterion here is that by selecting the candidate who would never lose against any other candidate, it picks the most preferred candidate, which in this case, leads to a good compromise that people across the political spectrum can live with. Thus, whenever the Condorcet winner is selected as the winner, it can be guaranteed that there is no spoiler effect that affects the winner in the election. This allows everyone to honestly list their opinions without worrying about strategic voting in order to make sure their second-choice candidate wins.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Condorcet criterion is not exactly as perfect as having no spoiler effect at all. There are some elections where none of the candidates are the Condorcet winner, which is known as <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-75-political-economy-and-economic-development-fall-2012/lecture-notes/MIT14_75F12_Lec12.pdf">Condorcet's paradox</a>. This paradox is similar to the rock-paper-scissors game: Rock can beat Paper in a one-on-one match, and Paper can beat Scissors in a one-on-one match, but then Scissors beats Paper in a one-on-one match, which leads to no overall Condorcet winner that can beat both of the other candidates. In this sort of paradox, a spoiler effect will be inevitable for any majoritarian voting method, including plurality voting, instant-runoff, and Condorcet, because no matter who is picked as the winner, there will always be another candidate who could have beaten that winner in a one-on-one match, which then leads to strategic voting. This paradox also leads to several different algorithms which always pick the Condorcet winner whenever possible, but have their own way of trying to pick the "best" winner in a Condorcet paradox. These algorithms are outside the scope of this blog post, but for those interested, I highly recommend looking into <a href="https://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Ranked_Pairs">ranked pairs</a>, <a href="https://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Schulze_method">Schulze</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Kemeny-Young_Maximum_Likelihood_Method">Kemeny-Young</a>. Furthermore, in an attempt to reconcile with the fact that there is not always one clear Condorcet winner in an election, some methods like <a href="http://www.fairvote.org/how_proportional_representation_elections_work">proportional representation</a> have developed in order to allow multiple winners in an election, which is most applicable in elections for representatives to a legislature. All of these alternatives are worth looking into as a solution to Condorcet's paradox. However, I still think the Condorcet criterion is better than instant-runoff despite Condorcet's paradox because there are elections like Burlington, 2009 in which the Condorcet criterion picks a fairer winner than instant-runoff, which leads to less of a spoiler effect and more honesty in voting.</p>

<p>Despite the advantage of the Condorcet criterion in avoiding the spoiler effect, some argue that <a href="http://www.fairvote.org/why-the-condorcet-criterion-is-less-important-than-it-seems">the Condorcet criterion is, in fact, a weaker method, than instant-runoff</a> because Condorcet winners can tend to be more moderate candidates, like Andy Montroll, which makes it harder for radical parties to gain a foothold. To be clear, my criticism with instant-runoff here is not that it failed to elect the moderate or mainstream candidate. On the contrary, a key goal of ranked-choice voting should be to allow people to vote for whichever candidate they want, even if they are outside the mainstream two parties. However, ranked-choice voting should not simply exist to allow new parties to be elected, but to create a good foundation for a multi-party system by allowing people to rank their true preferences without worrying too much about their honesty causing the election of a less-preferred candidate. Therefore, the problem with instant-runoff is that its failure to elect Condorcet winners inherently leads to less-preferred candidates winning in elections, which hinders the development of a multi-party system. It's important to realize that this failure to elect a good compromise in Burlington would directly lead to strategic voting in the next election because in order to prevent the Progressives from winning, many Republicans would likely vote Democrat as their first-choice so that the moderate candidate would win, which unjustly weakens the Republican party. Therefore, in this election, the two-party system simply shifts from Republican vs. Democrat to Democrat vs. Progressive, but in my opinion, it does not create a true three-party system because the rise of the Progressive is coupled with the unfair downfall of Republicans due to strategic voting. Thus, instant-runoff does not actually help create a system where multiple parties can sustainably coexist, but instead simply creates a system where the two-party system can more easily change.</p>

<p>In contrast, by eliminating the spoiler effect for Condorcet winners, the Condorcet criterion minimizes strategic voting, allowing people on both extremes to freely vote for their first-choice without too much worry about harming their moderate second-choice. This does not mean the Condorcet criterion will always lead to a moderate winning, but rather allows all parties to debate and run against each other without harming each other in unpreferable ways. Thus, a party on the extremes like Progressive can run without fear of causing a spoiler effect and even if they don't win, they can have a strong showing that causes more moderates or even people on the other side of the aisle to rank them as a first or second choice in future elections. These strong showings can eventually lead to the Progressive party becoming a Condorcet winner in an election and because they would be the Condorcet winner, Progressives would actually be preferred over Democrats by the majority, so this would not lead Republicans to strategically vote for Democrats. Thus, in the next election, all parties can still continue debating each other and being honest about their preferences. This means a win for a third-party under Condorcet is more sustainable and does not lead to the death of another party, which is why Condorcet allows for a true multi-party system, with three or more viable political parties running and debating each other strongly over multiple elections, instead of there just being two dominant political parties.</p>

<p>As it pertains to Maine, I think instant-runoff will help prevent the spoiler effects in some elections, like that which occurred in the 2014 gubenatorial election. However, if Maine ever develops a stronger third-party, elections will likely get more complicated and I fear instant-runoff may not be able to support a three-party system because of election results similar to Burlington, 2009. Therefore, I hope Maine eventually considers the Condorcet criterion or other solutions, like proportional representation for the state legislature, in order to help create a vibrant multi-party system.</p>
